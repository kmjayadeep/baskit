# TODO: Complete MVVM Architecture Implementation

## âœ… Completed Work (6/8 Phases)
- âœ… **All Screens**: Complete MVVM architecture with ViewModels and reactive state
- âœ… **Code Quality**: 100% MVVM compliance, zero service calls in UI, all tests passing
- âœ… **Widget Components**: Extracted 8+ reusable dialogs and UI helpers

## ðŸš§ MVVM Architecture: Complete Application Refactor

### ðŸŽ¯ **Scope**: All Screens + Repository Pattern
**Goal**: Implement consistent MVVM architecture across the entire application

### Phase 1-3: MVVM Foundation âœ…
**Completed**: Riverpod setup, ListsViewModel, UI integration

### Phase 4: Centralized Authentication Architecture âœ…
**Goal**: Create single AuthViewModel to eliminate auth duplication across ViewModels

- [x] Create `lib/view_models/auth_view_model.dart` with centralized `AuthState`
- [x] Add global `authViewModelProvider` as single source of auth truth
- [x] Refactor ProfileViewModel to use centralized auth instead of Firebase directly
- [x] Refactor ListsViewModel to watch centralized auth changes
- [x] Refactor ListDetailViewModel to use centralized `isAnonymous` state
- [x] Update all UI components to use centralized auth providers
- **Test**: Same auth functionality, cleaner architecture âœ…

### Phase 5: Repository Pattern (Global) âœ…
**Goal**: Abstract data layer with repository pattern

- [x] Create `lib/repositories/shopping_repository.dart` interface
- [x] Create `lib/repositories/storage_shopping_repository.dart` implementation  
- [x] Update all ViewModels to use Repository instead of direct StorageService
- [x] Create repository provider in Riverpod
- **Test**: Same functionality, better architecture âœ…

### Phase 6: Model Cleanup (Final)  
**Goal**: Pure domain models with zero UI logic

- [ ] Move UI helpers from ShoppingList model to ViewModels
- [ ] Move form helpers from models to ViewModels  
- [ ] Update all widgets to use ViewModel helpers instead of model methods
- [ ] Ensure models only contain business data (no UI logic)
- **Test**: Clean separation of concerns, identical functionality

## ðŸŽ¯ Validation
After each phase:
- `flutter test` (all 46 tests pass)
- `flutter analyze` (zero errors)
- Manual testing (app works identically)

## ðŸ“Š Current Status
```
âœ… Phase 1-3: MVVM Foundation (Complete)
âœ… All Screen ViewModels (Complete)  
âœ… Phase 4: Centralized Auth Architecture (Complete)
âœ… Phase 5: Repository Pattern (Complete)
ðŸš§ Phase 6: Model Cleanup (Final)
```

**Progress**: **5/6 Phases Complete (83%)**  
**Next**: Model Cleanup - Pure domain models with zero UI logic

**Estimated time**: 2-3 hours total, 30-45 minutes per phase
**Risk**: Low (incremental, non-breaking changes)
