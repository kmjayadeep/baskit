# Google Logo Setup Instructions

## Adding the Official Google Logo

To add the official Google logo to your Sign in with Google button:

1. **Download the official Google logo**:
   - Visit: https://developers.google.com/identity/branding-guidelines
   - Download the "G" icon in PNG format (18x18px recommended)
   - Choose the light themed version for best compatibility

2. **Add the logo to your assets**:
   - Save the downloaded PNG as `app/assets/google_logo.png`
   - Make sure it's exactly named `google_logo.png`

3. **Update the sign-in widget**:
   - Open `app/lib/widgets/auth/google_sign_in_widget.dart`
   - Replace the current icon line:
     ```dart
     icon: const Icon(Icons.account_circle, size: 18),
     ```
   - With the image asset:
     ```dart
     icon: Image.asset(
       'assets/google_logo.png',
       height: 18,
       width: 18,
       errorBuilder: (context, error, stackTrace) =>
           const Icon(Icons.account_circle, size: 18),
     ),
     ```

4. **Run flutter clean and rebuild**:
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
   ```

## Current Status
- ✅ Web configuration fixed (client ID added to index.html)
- ✅ Fallback icon implemented (Google sign-in works without the logo)
- ⏳ Waiting for official Google logo asset

The Google Sign-In functionality will work perfectly with the current icon fallback!
