<!-- 
INSTRUCTIONS:
To create a new release changelog, update latest.json with:

1. ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Update the "version" field to match the app version EXACTLY
   (Must match lib/constants/app_version.dart and pubspec.yaml)
2. Update the "title" (e.g., "Baskit 4.11.7")
3. Update the "items" list with your changes

The dialog will only show if the version in latest.json matches the app version.
This prevents showing outdated changelogs.

No need to create/delete files - just update latest.json!
