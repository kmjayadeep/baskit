# Local-First Storage Architecture Implementation Plan (v2)

## Overview

Convert Baskit from a dual-layer architecture to a true local-first model with robust background synchronization. This plan addresses critical requirements such as conflict resolution, deletion propagation, and seamless data merging on authentication.

### Current Issues
- `StorageService` switches between local and Firebase based on auth state.
- UI operations can be blocked by network calls.
- Complex and brittle routing logic in the `StorageService` facade.

### Target Architecture
- All UI operations interact *only* with the local Hive database for immediate feedback.
- A dedicated `SyncService` handles all network operations asynchronously in the background.
- A single, unified data flow for all application states.

---

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Secure API Key Management (Critical)
- **Issue**: Firebase API keys are currently hardcoded in `firebase_options.dart`, posing a significant security risk.
- **Action**:
    - Remove `firebase_options.dart` from version control.
    - Store all secrets and keys in a `.env` or `json` file that is added to `.gitignore`.
    - Inject keys at build time using `--dart-define` or `--dart-define-from-file`. This prevents keys from being exposed in the repository or the final app bundle.

---

## Core Concepts

### Data Models
To support robust synchronization, the data models must be updated:
- **`ShoppingList`**: Add `deletedAt: DateTime?`.
- **`ShoppingItem`**:
    - Add `deletedAt: DateTime?`.
    - **Add `updatedAt: DateTime?`**: This is critical for reliable conflict resolution during data sync. Without it, determining the newest version of an item is impossible.
- **Field Name Consistency**: Ensure field names are consistent across all layers (Model, Hive, Firestore). For example, the model uses `isCompleted` while Firestore was using `completed`. Standardize on `isCompleted`.

### Service Responsibilities

#### StorageService
- **Remains the single entry point for all UI-initiated data operations.**
- Simplifies to *only* communicate with `LocalStorageService`. No more auth-based logic.
- **Exception**: Cloud-only features like sharing may require a delegation mechanism to `FirestoreService`.

#### LocalStorageService
- Manages the local Hive database, including all CRUD operations and reactive streams.
- Implements soft deletes by marking records with `deletedAt`.

#### SyncService (New & Expanded)
- **Stateful Service**: Manages and exposes the current sync status (e.g., `idle`, `syncing`, `synced`, `error`) to the UI.
- **Bidirectional Sync**: Watches local data for changes to upload and listens to Firebase for changes to download.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Implements a granular, item-level merge strategy to prevent data loss.
- **Deletion Propagation**: Handles syncing soft deletes to Firestore and cleaning up local tombstoned records.
- **Initial Sync**: Manages the critical data merge process when a user first logs in.

#### FirestoreService
- Becomes a pure data layer for Firebase, containing no business logic. Handles direct Firebase CRUD and stream setup.

---

## Detailed Sync Logic

### 1. Conflict Resolution: Granular Merge Strategy
A simple "last write wins" on an entire list is insufficient. The `SyncService` will use a more granular approach:
- **List Properties (name, color, etc.):** The version with the more recent `updatedAt` timestamp wins.
- **Item List:** The service will merge the local and remote item lists:
    - For each item, compare the **`updatedAt` timestamp**. The newest version of the item is kept. This is dependent on the `updatedAt` field being added to the `ShoppingItem` model.
    - If an item exists on one side but not the other (and is not a tombstone), it is added.
    - This prevents a minor item edit from overwriting a list name change, and vice-versa.

### 2. Deletion Propagation: Tombstoning
To sync deletions, a soft-delete mechanism is required:
1.  **Local Deletion**: When a user deletes a list or item, the record in Hive is not removed. Instead, its `deletedAt` field is set to the current timestamp.
2.  **Sync to Cloud**: The `SyncService` detects the `deletedAt` timestamp and sends a delete command to Firestore for that record.
3.  **Cloud Deletion**: The record is permanently deleted from Firestore.
4.  **Local Cleanup**: After confirming the cloud deletion, the `SyncService` permanently removes the tombstoned record from the local Hive database.

### 3. Initial Sync on Login
To prevent data loss when a user with cloud data logs in on a new device (or after an anonymous session), the `SyncService` will:
1.  **Halt local sync.**
2.  **Fetch all lists** from Firestore.
3.  **Fetch all lists** from the local Hive database (from the anonymous session).
4.  **Merge the two datasets**:
    - For each list, apply the **Granular Merge Strategy** described above.
    - This intelligently combines anonymous and cloud data.
5.  **Save the merged dataset** as the new authoritative state in the local Hive database.
6.  **Resume bidirectional sync.**

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Data Model and StorageService Cleanup ✅
- **Tasks**:
    - ✅ Add `deletedAt: DateTime?` to `ShoppingList` and `ShoppingItem` Hive models. Run build runner.
    - ✅ **(In Progress)** Add `updatedAt: DateTime?` to `ShoppingItem` model.
    - ✅ Refactor `StorageService` to remove all auth-based routing and Firebase logic. All methods now call `LocalStorageService`.
    - ✅ Refactor `LocalStorageService` to implement soft deletes for lists and items (using `deletedAt`) instead of hard deletes.
    - ✅ Clean up unused migration code and resolve all analyzer warnings.

### Phase 2: Create FirestoreLayer Abstraction ✅
- **Tasks**:
    - ✅ Create a `FirestoreLayer` class that abstracts all direct Firebase operations.
    - ✅ This layer should handle `DocumentSnapshot` conversion and basic error handling.
    - **Recommendation**: Use Firestore's `withConverter()` API to standardize and centralize data conversion, preventing data inconsistency bugs.

### Phase 3: SyncService Foundation ✅
- **Tasks**:
    - ✅ Create the `SyncService` singleton.
    - ✅ Implement sync state management: `enum SyncState { idle, syncing, synced, error }` and expose it as a `ValueNotifier` or `Stream`.
    - ✅ Implement the core `determineSyncAction` logic based on timestamps and the `deletedAt` field.
    - ✅ Implement the granular `mergeLists` function for conflict resolution.

### Phase 4: Implement Bidirectional Sync
- **Tasks**:
    - **Local-to-Firebase**: Subscribe to local streams. When a change is detected, push it to `FirestoreLayer`. Handle `deletedAt` timestamps by calling the appropriate delete method.
    - **Firebase-to-Local**: Subscribe to Firebase streams (when authenticated). When a change is detected, merge it with local data using the `mergeLists` function.
    - **Sharing Feedback Loop**: Ensure that when a list is shared, the new member's `SyncService` automatically downloads and saves it to their local Hive.

### Phase 5: Authentication Event Integration
- **Tasks**:
    - Listen to `FirebaseAuthService.authStateChanges`.
    - **On Sign-In**: Trigger the **Initial Sync on Login** process described above.
    - **On Sign-Out**: Stop all sync operations and clear all local data to ensure privacy and a clean state for the next user.
    - **Note**: Re-evaluate if clearing all data is always desired. Consider only clearing on explicit account deletion to allow users to use the app offline after signing out.

### Phase 6: UI and Edge Cases
- **Tasks**:
    - **UI Feedback**: Create a widget (e.g., `SyncStatusIndicator`) that listens to the `SyncService.syncState` stream and displays the current status (e.g., "Synced", "Syncing...", "Offline").
    - **App Resume**: Implement logic to trigger a full sync when the app resumes after a long offline period.
    - **Error Handling**: Add comprehensive error handling and retry logic (e.g., exponential backoff) to the `SyncService`.

### Phase 7: Testing and Validation
- **Tasks**:
    - Write unit tests for the `mergeLists` and `determineSyncAction` logic.
    - Write integration tests for the full sync cycle: local change -> cloud -> other device.
    - Test all authentication scenarios: anonymous to signed-in, fresh install login, sign-out, etc.
    - Test collaboration scenarios with multiple users modifying the same list.
    - Test offline scenarios extensively.

## Current Status & Technical Debt

### ✅ **Completed (Phase 4a & 5)**
- **Local-to-Firebase sync**: Functional with authentication integration
- **Authentication event handling**: Auto-start/stop sync on sign-in/sign-out
- **SyncService initialization**: Properly integrated in main.dart
- **Error handling**: Graceful continuation when individual lists fail to sync
- **Unit tests**: All 27 sync service tests passing

### ⚠️ **Technical Debt & Known Issues**

#### 1. ~~**ID Mismatch Problem**~~ ✅ **FIXED**
- **Issue**: Local lists use UUID v4, Firebase generates auto-IDs
- **Solution**: Modified `FirestoreService.createList()` to use predetermined IDs from local lists
- **Implementation**: Changed from `_listsCollection.add({...})` to `_listsCollection.doc(list.id).set({...})`
- **Result**: Local and Firebase lists now maintain consistent UUIDs
- **Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Both list and item IDs are now consistent across local and Firebase storage

#### 2. **One-Way Sync Only** (High Priority)
- **Issue**: Only local-to-Firebase sync implemented
- **Missing**: Firebase-to-local sync for collaborative features
- **Impact**: Changes made by other users or on other devices won't appear locally
- **TODO**: Implement Phase 4b - Firebase-to-local sync

#### 3. ~~**Deletion Sync Issue**~~ ✅ **FIXED**
- **Issue**: Deleted lists were not being synced to Firebase due to stream filtering
- **Root Cause**: `watchLists()` filtered out soft-deleted lists, so SyncService never saw them
- **Solution**: Added `watchAllListsIncludingDeleted()` method for sync service
- **Implementation**: SyncService now uses separate stream that includes deleted lists
- **Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Deletions now properly sync from local to Firebase

#### 4. **Duplicate Creation Risk** (Medium Priority)
- **Issue**: No duplicate detection when sync runs multiple times
- **Impact**: May create multiple copies of same list in Firebase
- **Workaround**: `createList()` fails gracefully if list exists, but doesn't handle updates
- **TODO**: Add existence checking and update logic

#### 5. **No Initial Sync on Login** (Medium Priority)
- **Issue**: When user signs in, no merge of existing Firebase data with local anonymous data
- **Impact**: User may lose data or see incomplete state after authentication
- **TODO**: Implement initial sync merge strategy from plan

#### 6. ~~**Item Sync Issue**~~ ✅ **FIXED**
- **Issue**: New items added to lists were not being synced to Firebase
- **Root Cause**: SyncService only handled complete list creation, not incremental item changes
- **Solution**: Added incremental item sync with proper ID consistency
- **Implementation**: Enhanced `_handleActiveList()` to sync items when list updates fail/fallback
- **Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Items now properly sync from local to Firebase with consistent IDs

#### 7. **Missing UI Feedback** (Low Priority)
- **Issue**: No user-visible sync status indicators
- **Impact**: Users don't know if sync is working or failed
- **TODO**: Implement `SyncStatusIndicator` widget (Phase 6)

#### 8. **Flawed Sharing Logic in `StorageService` Facade** (High Priority)
- **Issue**: The `StorageService` is designed to be a pure facade over local storage, which breaks features that are cloud-only, like sharing. The service currently returns a hardcoded error, making the share button non-functional for authenticated users.
- **Impact**: Core collaboration feature is broken.
- **TODO**: The `StorageService` facade needs a mechanism to delegate to `FirestoreService` for specific cloud-only actions that cannot be handled locally.

#### 9. **Incorrect UI-level Undo Implementation** (Medium Priority)
- **Issue**: The "Undo" action for a deleted item in the UI re-creates the item instead of reverting the soft-delete (`deletedAt` timestamp).
- **Impact**: This creates a new item with a different `createdAt` time, leading to data duplication and sync conflicts.
- **TODO**: Refactor the undo logic in `ListDetailScreen` to find the soft-deleted item in the local database and set its `deletedAt` field back to `null`.

### 🧪 **Test Coverage Improvements**

Following the item sync bug discovery, comprehensive test coverage has been added:

#### ✅ **New Test Coverage Added:**
1. **FirestoreService.addItemToList Tests** - Verifies ID consistency and method behavior
2. **SyncService Item Sync Tests** - Unit tests for item sync logic and data handling
3. **End-to-End Item Flow Tests** - Integration tests covering complete user workflows:
   - Item addition with ID preservation
   - Item updates without ID changes
   - Item deletion with proper cleanup
   - Complete user shopping workflow simulation
4. **ID Consistency Tests** - Ensures local UUIDs are preserved in Firebase

#### **Test Files Added/Updated:**
- `test/services/firestore_service_test.dart` - Added item operations tests
- `test/services/sync_service_item_sync_test.dart` - New item sync integration tests
- `test/integration/local_first_flow_test.dart` - Added item sync flow tests

#### **Why These Tests Matter:**
The original item sync bug wasn't caught because we only tested:
- ✅ Conflict resolution algorithms (unit tests)
- ✅ Local storage operations (unit tests)
- ❌ **Missing**: Actual sync execution flow (integration tests)
- ❌ **Missing**: Firebase item operations (service tests)
- ❌ **Missing**: End-to-end user workflows (integration tests)

The new tests ensure similar sync issues are caught early in development.

### 📋 **Next Priority Actions**

1. ~~**Fix ID Mismatch**~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
2. ~~**Fix Item Sync Issue**~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
3. ~~**Add Comprehensive Test Coverage**~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
4. ~~**Add Firebase-to-Local Sync**~~ ✅ **COMPLETED** - Complete bidirectional sync
5. ~~**Add UI Sync Indicators**~~ ✅ **COMPLETED** - Show sync status to users
6. ~~🚨 **FIX RACE CONDITION**~~ ✅ **COMPLETED** - Prevent bidirectional sync loops
7. **Add Initial Sync on Login** - Merge anonymous + authenticated data
8. **Add Duplicate Prevention** - Check existence before creating (partially addressed with create/update fallback)

### ⚠️ **New Technical Debt from Phase 4b** (Bidirectional Sync Implementation)

#### 8. ~~**CRITICAL: Bidirectional Sync Race Condition**~~ ✅ **FIXED**
   - **Issue**: ~~Local-to-Firebase and Firebase-to-local syncs can create infinite loops~~ **RESOLVED**
   - **Root Cause**: ~~Server timestamps caused timestamp mismatches between client and server~~ **FIXED**
   - **Solution Applied**: **Replaced all `FieldValue.serverTimestamp()` with client timestamps**
     ```dart
     // OLD (caused race condition):
     await docRef.update({'updatedAt': FieldValue.serverTimestamp()});

     // NEW (prevents race condition):
     await docRef.update({'updatedAt': DateTime.now().toIso8601String()});
     ```
   - **Correction Required**: The current fix is incomplete. `FirestoreService` writes timestamps as ISO8601 strings, but `FirestoreRepository` expects `Timestamp` objects. This will cause runtime errors. The correct implementation is to use `Timestamp.fromDate(your_datetime_object)`.
   - **Benefits of Fix**:
     - ✅ **No race conditions**: Client timestamps are consistent across local/Firebase
     - ✅ **Simpler logic**: No need for timestamp tolerance or complex comparison
     - ✅ **Better performance**: Eliminates unnecessary sync loops
     - ✅ **Improved reliability**: Predictable sync behavior across devices
   - **Implementation**: **All FirestoreService methods now use client timestamps**
     - `createList()`: Uses single `DateTime.now()` for createdAt/updatedAt consistency
     - `updateList()`, `addItemToList()`, `updateItemInList()`: Use client timestamps
     - `shareListWithUser()`: Uses client timestamp for joinedAt
     - `initializeUserProfile()`: Uses client timestamp for createdAt
   - **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Race condition eliminated

#### 9. **Conservative Missing List Handling** ⚠️ **DATA CONSISTENCY ISSUE**
   - **Issue**: Lists that exist locally but not in Firebase are kept without cleanup
   - **Impact**:
     - Lists deleted by other users/devices remain on local device
     - Lists where sharing permissions were revoked still appear locally
     - No mechanism to clean up truly orphaned lists
   - **Solution**: Implement smarter detection logic:
     ```dart
     // TODO: Add logic to distinguish between:
     // 1. Lists deleted by others (should be removed locally)
     // 2. Local-only lists not yet synced (should be kept)
     // 3. Lists where sharing was revoked (should be removed locally)
     ```
   - **Location**: `_syncFirebaseListsToLocal()` method in `sync_service.dart`

#### 9. **No Sync Performance Optimization** 🚀 **PERFORMANCE ISSUE**
   - **Issue**: Each Firebase change triggers immediate processing without batching
   - **Impact**:
     - Rapid changes could cause performance issues
     - Potential Firebase quota exhaustion for high-activity users
     - UI could be overwhelmed with frequent updates
   - **Solution**: Implement batching and throttling:
     ```dart
     // TODO: Add debouncing/batching for Firebase changes
     // - Buffer changes for 500ms before processing
     - Process multiple changes in single batch operation
     // - Rate limit Firebase operations
     ```

#### 10. **Limited Error Recovery Strategy** 🔄 **RELIABILITY ISSUE**
   - **Issue**: Basic error handling without sophisticated retry logic
   - **Impact**:
     - Temporary network issues could cause permanent sync failures
     - Users don't get differentiated error messages
     - No automatic recovery from transient errors
   - **Solution**: Implement tiered error handling:
     ```dart
     // TODO: Add sophisticated error handling:
     // - Exponential backoff for network errors
     // - Different strategies for auth vs network vs permission errors
     // - Automatic retry for transient failures
     // - Better user-facing error messages
     ```

#### 11. **No Sync Progress Indication** 📊 **USER EXPERIENCE ISSUE**
   - **Issue**: Large sync operations don't show progress details
   - **Impact**:
     - Users don't know if large syncs are progressing or stuck
     - No indication of what's being synced (lists vs items)
     - Binary sync status doesn't reflect complex operations
   - **Solution**: Implement detailed progress tracking:
     ```dart
     // TODO: Add progress details:
     // - Number of lists/items being synced
     // - Current operation (downloading/uploading/merging)
     // - Progress percentage for large operations
     ```

#### 12. **Memory Usage for Large Datasets** 🧠 **SCALABILITY ISSUE**
   - **Issue**: Entire lists loaded into memory for comparison operations
   - **Impact**:
     - Could cause memory issues with very large shopping lists
     - Inefficient for users with hundreds of items per list
     - No pagination or streaming for massive datasets
   - **Solution**: Implement memory-efficient comparison:
     ```dart
     // TODO: Optimize memory usage:
     // - Stream-based comparison for large lists
     // - Pagination for massive item lists
     // - Hash-based change detection to avoid full object comparison
     ```

#### 13. **Missing Sync Metrics** 📈 **OBSERVABILITY ISSUE**
   - **Issue**: No tracking of sync performance or conflict patterns
   - **Impact**:
     - Can't identify sync bottlenecks or failure patterns
     - No data to optimize conflict resolution algorithms
     - Difficult to debug user-reported sync issues
   - **Solution**: Add comprehensive metrics:
     ```dart
     // TODO: Add sync analytics:
     // - Sync operation duration and success rates
     // - Conflict frequency and resolution patterns
     // - Network error patterns and retry success rates
     // - User behavior patterns (device switching, collaboration frequency)
     ```

### 🔧 **Code Quality Improvements** (Added from Dec 2024 Review)

Based on comprehensive codebase analysis, the following improvements have been identified:

#### **HIGH Priority (Implement Soon)**

8. **Add Missing FirebaseAuthService Tests** ⚠️ **CRITICAL GAP**
   - **Issue**: FirebaseAuthService has no test file despite being a core service
   - **Impact**: Authentication logic is not covered by tests
   - **Solution**: Create `app/test/services/firebase_auth_service_test.dart`
   - **Tests Needed**:
     ```dart
     test('should sign in anonymously', () async { ... });
     test('should sign in with Google', () async { ... });
     test('should handle sign out', () async { ... });
     test('should delete account', () async { ... });
     ```

9. **Fix Parameter Naming Consistency** 🏷️ **NAMING ISSUE**
   - **Issue**: Inconsistent parameter names across service layers
   - **Example**:
     ```dart
     StorageService.updateItem(..., bool? completed)        // ❌
     LocalStorageRepository.updateItem(..., bool? isCompleted) // ✅
     ```
   - **Solution**: Standardize on `isCompleted` across all services
   - **Files to Update**: `StorageService.updateItem()` method

10. **Refactor Static Services to Improve Testability** (High Priority)
    - **Issue**: Core services like `FirebaseAuthService` and `FirestoreService` use static methods exclusively, which makes them difficult to mock or test in isolation.
    - **Impact**: This creates tight coupling throughout the app and hinders the ability to write effective unit tests for dependent classes.
    - **Solution**: Refactor these services to use a singleton pattern (like `SyncService`) or prepare them for dependency injection.

#### **MEDIUM Priority (Next Sprint)**

11. **Enhance Method Documentation** 📚 **DOCUMENTATION**
    - **Issue**: Some public methods lack comprehensive documentation
    - **Impact**: API usage is not always clear to developers
    - **Solution**: Add JSDoc-style comments for all public methods
    - **Example**:
      ```dart
      /// Creates a new shopping list and persists it locally.
      ///
      /// Returns [true] if successful, [false] otherwise.
      /// Throws [ArgumentError] if list data is invalid.
      ///
      /// Example:
      /// ```dart
      /// final list = ShoppingList(id: 'uuid', name: 'Groceries', ...);
      /// final success = await storageService.createList(list);
      /// ```
      Future<bool> createList(ShoppingList list) async { ... }
      ```

12. **Add Input Validation** 🛡️ **ROBUSTNESS**
    - **Issue**: Critical methods lack input validation
    - **Impact**: Runtime errors from invalid data
    - **Solution**: Add comprehensive validation for all public methods
    - **Examples**:
      ```dart
      Future<bool> createList(ShoppingList list) async {
        if (list.name.trim().isEmpty) {
          throw ArgumentError('List name cannot be empty');
        }
        if (list.id.isEmpty) {
          throw ArgumentError('List ID cannot be empty');
        }
        // ...existing code
      }

      Future<bool> addItem(String listId, ShoppingItem item) async {
        if (listId.trim().isEmpty) {
          throw ArgumentError('List ID cannot be empty');
        }
        if (item.name.trim().isEmpty) {
          throw ArgumentError('Item name cannot be empty');
        }
        // ...existing code
      }
      ```

#### **LOW Priority (Future Improvements)**

13. **Consider Result Pattern Implementation** 🔄 **ARCHITECTURE**
    - **Issue**: Boolean returns don't provide error details
    - **Impact**: Limited error information for debugging
    - **Solution**: Implement Result pattern for better error handling
    - **Example**:
      ```dart
      class Result<T> {
        final bool success;
        final T? data;
        final String? error;
        final Exception? exception;

        Result.success(this.data) : success = true, error = null, exception = null;
        Result.failure(this.error, [this.exception]) : success = false, data = null;
      }

      // Usage:
      Future<Result<ShoppingList>> createList(ShoppingList list) async {
        try {
          // ... validation and creation logic
          return Result.success(createdList);
        } catch (e) {
          return Result.failure('Failed to create list: ${e.message}', e);
        }
      }
      ```

14. **Add Method Overloads for Common Use Cases** 🚀 **DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE**
    - **Issue**: Some common operations require verbose parameter passing
    - **Solution**: Add convenience overloads
    - **Example**:
      ```dart
      // Current: verbose for simple updates
      await updateItem(listId, itemId, name: 'New Name');

      // Proposed: convenience methods
      Future<bool> updateItemName(String listId, String itemId, String name) async {
        return updateItem(listId, itemId, name: name);
      }

      Future<bool> toggleItemCompletion(String listId, String itemId) async {
        final item = await getItem(listId, itemId);
        return updateItem(listId, itemId, isCompleted: !item.isCompleted);
      }
      ```
